    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we started with a bit of data processing. We opened a file, tried to find the correct data and then use/manipulate that data for further operations. At the start we experienced already a problem, namely the naming of files on different operating systems (OS, e.g., Linux, Mac and Windows). Windows users had to change the path to the file they wanted to open while Mac users were okay. When exchanging scripts with users of different OS's it is annoying to have to manually change filenames. Even mentioning *manually* means that there is something wrong, we are automating things after all! Luckily for us that Python comes with a library (what a suprise) that can handle this issue for us. Meet ***os.path***!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The os.path library\n",
    "The *os.path* library comes with Python so there is no need to install it (actually the library is *os* and *path* is a library module, module for short). The module has several functions that can make our lives easier when dealing with files and directories (folders). The functions in *os.path* are not changing anything about the files so they are safe to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File and filepaths\n",
    "Files on your computer are categorized (hopefully) in directories. You have a directory where Windows/Mac store all the essential OS files, there is a directory for your pictures etc. Directories and their contents reside on a physical disc (M2, SSD, harddrive, USB). On Windows these are the C: and the D: drives for example. A full path to a file on Windows might read *C:\\Users\\Hans\\Documents\\AMS\\WS4.ipynb*. *C:* is the drive letter, *\\Users\\Hans\\Documents\\AMS\\* is the path, *WS4* is the human readable filename and *.ipynb* is the file extension (the file type). Windows often hides the extensions and uses icons to denote filetypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Absolute and relative paths\n",
    "When you run a script, you run the script from somewhere, usually from the directory where it is located. This is the current working directory."

Moving from */home/hans/Documents/python* to */home/hans/Documents* is moving up (moving to the left in the path string), from */home/hans/Documents* to */home/hans/Documents/python* is moving down. Moving down is as simple as just specifying the directory name. Moving up is done by using two dots, e.g. \"..\". So if I am in */home/hans/Documents/python* and I say go to \"..\" I will end up in */home/hans/Documents*. If I then want to go to the *csv* directory I type *csv*. So ../csv is the **relative path** from my current working directory to */home/hans/Documents/csv*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in the Windows command prompt or in the shell on Mac, you need to type *cd ..* to move up and *cd name* to move down. Give it a try. The *cd* stand for change directory.\n",

You can install Pandas when you go to your shell (command line) and issue the following command: *py -m pip install pandas*. While your at it, also install [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), *py -m pip install plotly* and Matplotlib: *py -m pip install matplotlib*. When you install the libraries, probably a whole bunch of other libraries will get installed as well.
